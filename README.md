git repo to store my vim and bash scripts and other settings

clone repo to HOME folder and run
```
$ cd
$ linux_env/setup
```

`linux_env/bin` contains some common commands and is in path, for local bin `~/bin` is in path, so you can symlink various binaries there.
.bashrc loads .local_bashrc so you could put any local specific/private changes there.
